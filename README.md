# *************** THE SOLUTION ***************
## Run Locally

Clone this repo
Run npm install
Modify src/config/local.js if you need to change port# from 3001
Run npm run dev

## Deploy to Production
Port number on production is set to process.env.PORT otherwise defaults to 3001. You can change this behavior in src/config/production.js if you need to.

Run npm install
Run npm run prod

### Heroku

I am hosting this API on heroku under the following root URL:

https://enigmatic-harbor-78678.herokuapp.com/

## API Design Notes
### /

server.js - entry point

### /src
/config - Loads local or production server variables
/controllers - Defines the specific endpoint paths
/database - This is where the data comes from. Currently using in-memory instead of persistent data
/models - Eventually this is where an ODM will handle data retrieval and manipulations
/routes - Defines high-level routes
/server - Build and start the server
/services - This is the layer before the ODM. This is also where we do error handling in regard to the data
utils - Any and all helper methods should go here

## API Documentation
NOTE: ALL API endpoints will return an updated list of surveys or an error object
### GET /api/surveys
Get a list of surveys including questions and responses.

Sample response:
```
{
    "message": "surveys fetched successfully",
    "data": [
        {

```

### POST /api/surveys
Create new survey. Requires one field ```questions``` of type Array which contains the questions this survey holds.
Each question must a be a valid JSON object with the following fields:

* type: String
* content: String

Example Post Body
```
{
            "questions": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "content": "What is your name"
                }
            ]
}
```

### DELETE /api/questions/:surveyId/:questionId
Delete a question within a survey.
Note: This does not delete responding responses to the deleted question

```:surveyId``` must be a valid survey id
```:questionId``` must be a valid question id within the parent survey

### POST /api/questions/:surveyId
Add a question to a survey.

```:surveyId``` must be a valid survey id

Example Post Body

```
{
    "type": "text", "content": "Tell us about yourself?"
}
```

### PUT /api/questions/:surveyId
Modify a question within the survey with the given id

```:surveyId``` must be a valid survey id

Example Body

```
{
    "id": 693935699,
    "content": "What is your FIRST name?"
}
```

### PUT /api/questions/reorder/:surveyId

# *************** THE CHALLENGE ***************
# Product Description
SurveysAPI is a JSON REST API for creating, modifying, and submitting surveys. A survey is an ordered list of survey questions. Supported types of questions include:
- Text Entry (free form) (ex: "What is your name")
- Multiple Choice (ex: "Which color do you like the best? Choose one: [Orange, Green, Blue, Red]")
- Date (ex: "What is your birthdate?")
  - NOT timestamp; this is date-only

# Challenge Overview
This challenge has two parts (instructions for each appear below):
1. Coding Portion
2. Written Portion

Submission Instructions:
- Clone this repository and create your own remote to push it to.
- Implement the coding portion.
- Include your response to the written portion in the README.
- When ready, invite me (patrick.wickham@alcoverooms.com) to your remote.
  - Note: I will not look at git history.

# Coding Portion Instructions
## Requirements
Implement REST APIÂ endpoints (JSON) for the following pieces of functionality:
- Create a survey
  - See "Product Description" for types of questions you must support
- Modify a previously created survey
  - Add/Remove questions
  - Modify a question
  - Reorder questions
- Submit to a survey

You may organize the code however you see fit, including creating/moving files/folders.

In addition to the code, please also provide _brief_ overview of its usage, so I can see the API design. This can come in the form of comments, README, or an external script that demonstrates the use of each endpoint.

### Note:
These are just use cases, not necessarily API endpoints. Your API can have as many endpoints as you see fit.

## Tech Specs
- Must be runnable on a Node version >v10
- Must be pure nodejs (no typescript)
- Do not use npm libraries for any core features
  - If there's a library you think should be used, you may email me at patrick.wickham@alcoverooms.com to get approval
- Must be runnable as Express server using `npm run dev` script and accessible locally on port 3001
  - This is already provided

## Getting Started
- Clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## You will be graded on:
- API Design (Usability for clients)
- Code Readability
- Overall Simplicty
- Extensibility
#### Example questions you should ask to evaluate your submission (but not implement):
(This list is not exhaustive)
- How easy would it be for a new contributor to pick up the project?
- How easy would it be to plug in a database layer?
- How easy would it be to add another type of survey question?
- How easy would it be to add other new features (search surveys / submissions, list submissions, store user data, etc)?
## You will NOT be graded on
- Performance (Readable code > Optimized code)
- Implementation of out-of-scope features
## Out of scope
- Using a database or any persistent storage
- User management or identities (Assume API is used "anonymously" ie as a private service)
- Authentication
- Frontend
- Formal documentation

# Written Portion Instructions
Create a brief (one-paragraph, or bulleted list) of what technical steps would be required to deploy this app to production. (This should _not_ include possible new features; assume the provided feature set is complete).

# Questions / Issues?
Email me at patrick.wickham@alcoverooms.com and I will respond as soon as I can.
